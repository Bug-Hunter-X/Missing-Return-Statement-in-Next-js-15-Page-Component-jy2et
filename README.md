# Missing Return Statement in Next.js 15 Page Component

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js 15: a missing `return` statement in a page component.  Next.js 15, with its improved React support, enforces stricter rules, leading to this error if a `return` isn't present, even if the component appears to render correctly in older Next.js versions.

## Problem:

The `pages/about.js` file lacks a `return` statement within the functional component, causing a runtime error.

## Solution:

Ensure all functional page components in Next.js 15 explicitly return JSX.  The solution is simple: add the necessary `return` statement with the desired JSX to render.
